# Improved Visual Snapping Features

## What Was Fixed

The snapping functionality has been significantly improved to provide better visual feedback and more reliable "butt-to-butt" snapping between action blocks.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Snap Distance
- **Increased base snap distance** from 20px to 30px for easier snapping
- **Adaptive distance range** from 15-50px based on zoom level
- **More forgiving** snap threshold for better user experience

### 2. Improved Visual Feedback
- **Thick, glowing snap lines** when blocks are about to snap together
- **Golden lines** for action block edges (4px thick with glow effect)
- **Red lines** for timeline boundaries (4px thick with glow effect)
- **Green snap indicators** at exact snap points
- **White drag indicators** on the block being moved (larger, more visible)
- **Label backgrounds** for better text readability

### 3. Better Drag Logic
- **Smarter snap detection** that only applies when within reasonable distance
- **Improved block movement** with better boundary handling
- **More responsive** snapping during resize operations
- **Enhanced feedback** with improved logging and timing

## Visual Cues

### When Dragging Action Blocks:
1. **Golden Lines**: Appear when approaching other action block edges
2. **Red Lines**: Appear when approaching timeline start/end
3. **Green Dots**: Show exactly where the block will snap
4. **White Circles**: Highlight the edges of the block you're dragging
5. **Text Labels**: Show which block/edge you're snapping to (at higher zoom levels)

### Snap Behavior:
- **Start-to-End**: Action block start edge snaps to another block's end edge
- **End-to-Start**: Action block end edge snaps to another block's start edge
- **Boundary Snapping**: Blocks snap to timeline start (0:00) and end
- **Resize Snapping**: Handle dragging respects snap points
- **Move Snapping**: Moving entire blocks snaps intelligently to nearest edge

## Usage Tips

1. **Load an MP3 file** first to see the timeline
2. **Drag actions** from the toolbar (Actions 1-20) onto the action timeline
3. **Drag blocks** by clicking and dragging the center
4. **Resize blocks** by dragging the white handles on the edges
5. **Watch for visual cues** - golden/red lines indicate snap opportunities
6. **Use the 'S' key** or checkbox to toggle snapping on/off
7. **Zoom in** for more precise control and better visual feedback

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **S**: Toggle snap on/off
- **+/-**: Zoom in/out
- **F**: Fit timeline to window
- **Space**: Play/pause audio
- **Delete**: Remove selected action block
- **C/V**: Copy/paste action blocks

## Technical Details

- **Snap distance**: Automatically adjusts based on zoom level (15-50 pixels)
- **Time threshold**: Converts pixel distance to time for accurate snapping
- **Performance**: Optimized drawing with minimal canvas redraws
- **Feedback**: Smart logging prevents spam while providing useful feedback

The snapping now provides professional-grade precision similar to Final Cut Pro's magnetic timeline!
