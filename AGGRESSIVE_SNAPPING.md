# AGGRESSIVE SNAPPING UPDATE

## What I Fixed

The action blocks now have **AGGRESSIVE SNAPPING** that will make them connect perfectly "butt-to-butt" when dragged near each other.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. More Aggressive Snap Distance
- **Increased base snap distance** from 30px to 40px
- **Expanded range** from 20-60px (was 15-50px)
- **Larger snap threshold** for better detection

### 2. Direct Snap Application
- **REMOVED conditional snap checking** - if snap is enabled and you're within range, it WILL snap
- **Direct position assignment** - the block moves exactly to the snap point, no approximation
- **No more "reasonable distance" checks** - if you're in snap range, it snaps perfectly

### 3. Enhanced Visual Feedback
- **Thicker snap lines** (6px wide for action edges, 5px for boundaries)
- **Bigger glow effects** (±2px offset instead of ±1px)
- **Larger snap indicators** with crosshairs to show exact snap points
- **Better contrast** with yellow labels on black backgrounds
- **More visible drag indicators** (6px radius instead of 5px)

## How It Works Now

### When Resizing Blocks:
1. **Drag a resize handle** (white squares on block edges)
2. **Visual guides appear** when you get within snap range (40+ pixels)
3. **Golden lines** show where other action blocks are
4. **Green circles with crosshairs** show exact snap points
5. **Block edge SNAPS EXACTLY** to the snap point - no approximation!

### When Moving Blocks:
1. **Drag the center** of any action block
2. **Both edges** are checked for snap opportunities
3. **The closest snap point** is used automatically
4. **Entire block moves** so the snapping edge aligns perfectly
5. **"SNAPPED to Action X end/start"** message appears in the log

## Visual Cues

### Snap Lines:
- **GOLDEN (6px thick)**: Action block edges - these are your snap targets
- **RED (5px thick)**: Timeline boundaries (start/end)
- **Both have glow effects** for maximum visibility

### Snap Indicators:
- **GREEN CIRCLES with BLACK CROSSHAIRS**: Exact snap points
- **WHITE CIRCLES with RED BORDERS**: Your dragging block edges
- **YELLOW TEXT on BLACK**: Labels showing what you're snapping to

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open Audio Timeline** and load an MP3 file
2. **Drag 2-3 actions** from the toolbar onto the timeline
3. **Try moving one block** close to another - it should SNAP exactly to the edge
4. **Try resizing** a block near another - the edge should SNAP perfectly
5. **Look for "SNAPPED to Action X" messages** in the terminal log
6. **Verify blocks are perfectly adjacent** with no gaps when snapped

## What Should Happen

- **Blocks should connect perfectly** with zero gap between them
- **Visual guides should be VERY obvious** when snapping is about to happen  
- **Log messages confirm** exactly what you snapped to
- **No more "close but not quite"** - it's either snapped perfectly or not snapped

## Debug Info

If snapping still isn't working perfectly:
1. **Check the terminal log** for "SNAPPED to..." messages
2. **Look for bright visual guides** during dragging
3. **Try at different zoom levels** - snapping works at all zoom levels
4. **Make sure "Snap" checkbox is checked** in the timeline interface

The snapping is now MUCH more aggressive and should create perfect butt-to-butt connections!
